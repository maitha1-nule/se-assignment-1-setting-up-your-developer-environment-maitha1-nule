##This is the process I followed to set up my development Environment.

1. 
I started with installing Windows 11 on my laptop. I did this using a bootable USB drive. 
I downloaded the Windows 11 ISO file from the Microsoft website and used Rufus to create a bootable USB drive.
I then booted my laptop from the USB drive and installed Windows 11.
To confriom that Windows 11 was installed, I checked the system properties by right-clicking on the start button
and selecting system. This is the scr!eenshot to confirm that Windows 11 was installed.
