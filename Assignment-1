##This is the process I followed to set up my development Environment.

1. 
I started with installing Windows 11 on my laptop. I did this using a bootable USB drive. 
I downloaded the Windows 11 ISO file from the Microsoft website and used Rufus to create a bootable USB drive.
I then booted my laptop from the USB drive and installed Windows 11.
To confriom that Windows 11 was installed, I checked the system properties by right-clicking on the start button
and selecting system. This is the screenshot to confirm that Windows 11 was installed.
The screenshot is, Windows11.png

2. my prefered text editor is viual studion code. Ive attached a screenshot of it, to prove I've actually installed it. The name of the screenshot is tillteled, Visual Studio code.png
